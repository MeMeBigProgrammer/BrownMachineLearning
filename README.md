# Summer @ Brown MachineLearning
I attended a three week Machine Learning course taught at Brown University during the summer of 2019. These are copies of the Programming notes, and some of the programs I wrote. 

In this Repo, there is code for the following:

1. Perceptron algorithm
2. Gradient Descent
3. MNist single layer implementation
4. Random Walk with sentence generation
