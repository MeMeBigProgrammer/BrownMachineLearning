Although extremely well known, it is necessary at the outset to give a brief outline of the argument for completeness. Searle envisages a situation in which he is hidden in a room and is presented questions in Chinese written on an ‘input’ card, posted in to his room by unseen enquirers. Searle knows no Chi-
nese; indeed, he is quite unaware of the enterprise in which he is engaged and
is ignorant of the fact that the strange marks on the cards represent questions
framed in Chinese. He consults a manual telling him (in English) precisely what
equally strange marks to write on an ‘output’ card, which he posts back to the
outside world. By virtue of the ‘machine intelligence’ embodied in the manual
(which is actually a formalisation of the steps in an AI program), these marks
on the output card constitute an answer to any input question. To a Chinese
speaker external to the room, by virtue of its question answering ability, the
system passes the Turing test for machine intelligence
